This project examines how EEG signals and lifestyle information can be combined to predict epilepsy-related outcomes using machine learning. I used two different datasets: an EEG seizure recognition dataset and a lifestyle dataset that contains factors such as stress, sleep quality, fatigue, aura, medication, and injury. After preparing and merging both datasets, I developed models for two types of predictions: seizure classification (seizure vs. non-seizure) and seizure count regression. Multiple models were applied, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost. The classification models performed extremely well because EEG patterns create a clear separation between seizure and non-seizure signals. Regression models performed moderately since seizure frequency is influenced by many external factors not present in the dataset.
